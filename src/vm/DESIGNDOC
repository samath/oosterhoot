			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT

  Entry in the supplemental page table, used for associating
  virtual addresses with their corresponding physical frames
  (or lack of).

  struct supp_page
    {
      uint32_t *uaddr;
      struct hash_elem hash_elem;
      struct list_elem list_elem;
      struct frame *fte;
      struct thread *thread;
    };

  The supplemental page table, with a lock for insertion/deletion
  and a main hash table for address-based lookups.

  struct supp_page_table
    {
      struct hash hash_table;
      struct lock lock;
    };

Since virtual-to-physical mappings are arbitrary and follow no
particular order, we used a hash table to ensure constant-time
lookups on virtual addresses. The alternative would be keeping a
list of each virtual-physical map entry, which would require
a longer linear scan of the entire supplemental page table.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

  Identifies how the physical frame should be populated,
  whether with zeroes, mmapped data, or swapped-in data.

  enum frame_source
    {
      FRAME_ZERO,
      FRAME MMAP,
      FRAME_SWAP
    };

  An entry keeping track of a physical frame and the page tables
  referencing the frame. When the frame is evicted, stores the
  swap or file location to which it ws written.
  
  struct frame
    {
      uint32_t *paddr;
      struct list users;
      struct list_elem elem;
      enum frame_source src;
      uint32_t aux;
      bool ro;
      bool pinned;
      struct lock lock;
    };


  struct swap_table
    {
      struct bitmap *map;
      struct block *swap_block;
      struct lock swap_table_lock;
    };


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

We implemented the clock algorithm from lecture. A "clock hand"
pointer is initialized to point to some element in the frame table
list. On eviction, we lock the frame table with a global lock
and iterate the clock hand through the list of allocated frames.

When the clock hand passes a frame that has been accessed by
any of its users (indicated by the corresponding page tables),
we zero the accessed bit(s) and move on. Otherwise, the frame
is selected for eviction. If it is not dirty, the frame is
palloc_freed immediately. Otherwise, its data is written back
to the location specified by the src field and then freed.

Contains a hash to contain mmap_entry's and a single lock to synchronize
access to the hash.
  /* mmap_table */
  struct mmap_table 
    {
      struct hash table;
      struct lock lock;
    };

Contains info for allocating and deallocating frames from a memory-mapped
file.
  struct mmap_entry
    {
      mapid_t map_id;
      struct file *fp;
      struct file_map *fm;
      void *uaddr;
      unsigned num_pages;
      unsigned zero_bytes;
      struct hash_elem hash_elem;
    };

Used to keep track of which elements in the file-map table from Project 2
are file descriptors and which represent memory mappings.
  enum fm_mode
    {
      FM_MODE_FD,
      FM_MODE_MMAP
    };

Updated file_with_lock (used as a return value for fd lookups) to contain 
fm_mode.
  struct file_with_lock {
    struct file *fp;
    struct lock *lock;
    enum fm_mode mode;
  }

Page faults and eviction are each handled by the appropriate methods within
frame.c. (frame_alloc and frame_dealloc).  Each contains a switch statement
that checks the frame_src enum in the frame entry.

In a page fault, the handler uses the stored mmap_entry pointer and 
retrieves the corresponding lock from the file-map.  It then reads in
each page from the file, setting the remaining bytes to zero.

Eviction (which shares deallocation code with munmap and destroy, for
freeing the mapped files on exit) calls frame_dealloc.  This checks for 
three properties: a) The frame is used for an mmap file
                  b) The frame is not read only
                  c) The physical page is marked dirty
If all of these are true, the handler again uses the stored mmap_entry to 
write all changes back to the original file.


>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.


Any page that has already been allocated, for an existing file mapping, 
segment, or otherwise, has an entry in the supplemental page table.  This 
is true even if that page has never been touched.

Therefore, before opening the file, allocating a new map_id, or inserting
a new mmap_entry, the syscall handler calculates the number of pages
required for the mapping.  For each virtual page, the handler checks that
the page is a valid virtual address and that no entry currently exists in 
the supplemental page table.  If all of these checks pass, it inserts the 
relevant pages and maps the file.

Executable loading shares the same code paths for allocation and deallocation
of frames, but does not directly use mmap or munmap.  Each segment creates a
dummy mmap_entry, which is never entered into an mmap-table.  This entry is 
initialized with valid file pointers and file size information, such that the
first access to the frame can read in from the file system correctly.  

Since this mmap_entry is never used or given a valid map_id, we can check
when freeing a frame with source FRAME_MMAP if it was created by an mmap () 
system call or a loaded executable.  In the second case, the data then 
is shifted to swap space. This difference only appears when evicting or 
exiting a data page, and after the first eviction it is treated as any other 
space in the swap table.

This strategy for managing executables is convenient because it takes advantag
of the existing infrastructure.  Since all loading and writing to disk are 
handled in frame_alloc and frame_dealloc, sharing the code path without 
using an actual mmap_table is the most effective solution.
